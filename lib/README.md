# LampJs

LampJs is a lightweight js framework. Documentation coming soon.

<br>

## Create LampJs project

To create a new LampJs project run

```sh
pnpm create lampjs-app
```

## To note

LampJs uses a variation of signals that is pure javascript, no compiler used. LampJs does not support a lot of usual syntax you may expect from frameworks like React or SolidJs such as being able to loop over a state and having it update reactivly (yikes). The purpose of this framework is to create an easy and lightweight way of interacing with a simple state model for simple apps. I mostly use it as a bootstrap for creating a demo with `SimulationJS`
